									<h1>Group Listening App <br /> UI Design<br /></h1>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/auxThumb1.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This is a prototype design for a group music listening app that I made for my INST 311: Information Organization course in 2022. This was my first time using Figma, and the goal of the project was to come up with an execute an app idea that could be applied to information organization concepts, included defining the scope of our app, user types, and tasks that can be performed by each user type.</p>
								<p>My group landed on this idea after noting how difficult it was at the time to listen to music in a group of people. Our proposed app was called "Pass The Aux", and it would allow users in a group to send music all to one device, as well as allowing the group to vote for songs to be played next, as well as creating playlists from the sessions they had.</p>
								<p>As for the design itself, I designed all 6 of the following screens. Sign in, Session Host Settings, Active Session, Session Members, Previous Sessions, and User Settings.</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/auxAllScreens.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The app would have two user types, host and guest. The host is the creator and "host" of a music listening session. Ideally it would be someone with at least one music streaming service to be paired, be it Spotify, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. Someone with more paired apps would be the most ideal host. Before creating a session, hosts would be greeted with the Session Host Settings screen, which would allow them to toggle voting and enable or disable specific votes, the treat host as guest option, as well as the option to import a playlist into the session before starting, or the option of generating a smart session based on the music tastes of users within the session. </p>
								<p>The Active Session screen would be the main screen that users would interact with during their music listening. The screen would display the current playing song, the upcoming queue, and would allow users to both score songs positively or negatively, as well as vote to skip the current song or remove upcoming songs within the queue.</p>
								<p>The Session Members button on the top right would lead to it's respective page, which would display the host and all the members within a current session. The host can kick users from the session, or send the audio to a guest's device if they did not want audio playing from their device, but from another user's device instead, as they might be the one with their device connected to a speaker for example.</p>
								<p>The Previous Sessions screen would display your session history, including session names, who the host was, the date of the session, the peak member number, and more, and the screen would allow the user to filter by any of those parameters. Sessions can be favorited within the app and exported to your primary connected music streaming account, which is set in the User Settings page. Users can also generate a smart session, which queues up songs based on what was most liked from their previous sessions.</p>
								<p>As this was my absolute earliest UI design, there is many things I would change if I went back to this project and did a second pass. For one, I find that having a proper background for on screen text to be placed on not only looks nicer, but also helps to add contrast incase text is difficult to read, like the greyed out text over a white background on the User Settings page, for example. There is also a lot of small text cramped up on the Previous Sessions page, so I would allow for scrolling on that page as well. Finally, I would give the vote tab on the Active Session page a proper screen to vote with, or at least a bigger popup that could be clicked away.</p>
								<p>Still, the purpose of adding this design to my portfolio is to note my progress as a front end designer, as well as to strengthen my ability to look back on past designs in order to better my future designs. For my very first design and my very first time using Figma, I'm still proud of what I accomplished with this design and this very rough app prototype.</p>
