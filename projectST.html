								<p>This is a prototype design I worked on for my INST 402: Patient Centered Design course in 2024. This project was a multi-step process to make a first pass at a prototype sleep tracker to solve adolescent sleep deprivation, which included doing background research, a competitive analysis, and more.
								<p>Since it was a group project, the screens I personally designed were the above "Sleep Data Tracking", "Day-to-Day Sleep Stats", and "Tailored Recommnedations" screens. This was the rough pass that we made, as the focus for this project was the back up our research, rather than make a highly polished prototype. For this project, we were tasked with selecting a problem statement that helps a specific target population. Initially, we focused on solving pain points within the health and wellness space that included common problems that lots of people face in their day-to-day lives, and eventually landed on helping people form healthy sleeping habits. We then focused that idea down to the specific population of middle and high school students, as they often face sleep deprivation due to early wake-up times, with nothing to set them back on track to restore and maintain healthy sleep hygiene. We did deeper research on adolesent sleep health and found interesting findings regarding our target population. Some examples include the CDC stating that not enough sleep in middle and high schoolers can lead to “an increased risk for …poor mental health, attention and behavior problems, and poor academic performance” (Wheaton, 2018), as well as the Sleep Foundation noting that over half of all middle and high school students don't get enough sleep at night (Suni & Dimitriu, 2023). </p>
								<p>During our competitive analysis, we looked at existing products on the market that might work similarly to our solution to find out what is already being done, and what we could do better than the existing products. We looked at smart watches like the Apple Watch, and Google's Pixel Watch, and their associated health apps, as well as third party health wearables like the Fitbit and the Oura Ring, and other third party "hearables" like Sleep Score and Sleep Cycle, that track your sleep by recording the noises you make during sleep. We found that most people use any of these first or third party devices because of the convenience of pairing with your device. However, we found that with these solutions they would track and report your sleep data, but typically would never teach the user about what that reported data actually meant. Furthermore, there was nothing on the market that was specifically geared towards students who would benefit from such an app being used to help them build sleep habits to wake up on time for school with ease, as well as helping busy students who have difficulty managing their time in regards to sleep. On top of that, many of the apps would require a paid subscription to get all the features, which full time students typically can't afford to access.</p>
								<p>Our proposed solution was to provide a free and easy access alternative to the current solutions on the market, but it would also allow users to import data from the wearables they might already own, as well as using their phone to be a hearable device if they didn't have a wearable. Additionally, it would give users information on their sleep data, as well as what exactly that data means, and what the user's next steps would be to improve their sleep, specifically geared towards students having trouble getting good sleep for their upcoming school day.</p>
								<p>When designing the app, while including our basic features, we also wanted the design itself to be tailored for both parents and children who would want to track and learn about their sleep. To solve for this we designed the app to be able to convey information about sleep, without being too bland or too information heavy with both audiences in mind. Our design also accounted for being a seamless and non-intrusive experience, something that was easy enough for users to actively want to include in their daily routines. The user puts in little effort to reap the benefits of getting to know their sleep data, what it means in detail, and being given next steps that are specifically tailored for them.</p>
								<p>This is one of my earlier designs done in college, so there is a LOT I would have done differently in a redesign. While the information is good, we were limited to make something quickly presentable, so we had to squeeze as much as we could into each screen, which leaves them super cluttered, and just being given some scroll space would easily fix our design. Also, since it's just a first pass, it isn't nearly as clean or as modern as I would have liked it to be.</p>
