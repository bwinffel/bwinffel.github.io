									<h1>Music Social Media App <br /> UI Design<br /></h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/enesThumb.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This is a prototype design for a social media app focused around music to facilitate better discovery of up-and-coming musicians, made for my ENES 461: Advanced Entrepreneurial Opportunity Analysis in Technology Ventures course in 2023. Being an entrepreneurial course, we were tasked with identifying a problem within any industry that could be solved with a potential product. We had to go in depth to not only identify, but also prove that the problem existed, as well as evaluating our target customer, their wants and needs, the gains and pains they might experience, identify competitors and their customers, and more. The purpose being that by the end of the course you would have an actionable entrepreneurial plan that you could execute on.</p>
								<p>The problem I set out to solve with my app was the problem that many talented musicians are often forgotten if they were even lucky enough to be initially discovered. Many of those artists who did end up being discovered could not make enough money doing music to have it be sustainable for them. So my app would address this problem by creating a more artist-centric social media platform, where listeners of music could easily discover new artists and support them on that same platform.</p>
								<p>I designed 5 prototype screens for an algorithmic music discovery platform that would allow users to find music from both new and existing artists, and then from there discover more artists based on their listening tastes. Within the app, listeners could also save, listen, and share songs and playlists with other users, as well as find upcoming concerts for artists, buy merchandise, and even support the artist directly via a tipping feature, allowing users to support the artist directly and send them a personal message along with it.</p>
								<p>In essence, the app would function as a hybrid between a social media platform like Tiktok or Instagram Reels, and a music streaming service like Spotify or Apple Music</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/enesAllScreens.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The Home page would present the user short form video content, showcasing an artist music video for example. This is similar to Tiktok's "For You Page" where it takes what a user already likes and the user scrolls down to the next video, which is a suggested video based on that user's preferences. The app would continuously curate content as the user keeps interacting with new content presented on the app, either via the Home screen videos or through the artists they follow or the songs that they like or listen to. </p>
								<p>Artists can setup profiles for users to follow, as well as where their songs, and videos are hosted. From artist profiles, users can listen to songs, watch music videos, read more about the artist, or advance to the Support the Artist page.</p>
								<p>The Support the Artist page would allow users to view an artist's upcoming concerts and buy tickets, buy from the artist's merch store, or support the artist directly via a custom tip that also gives the user the option to acommpany their tip with a personal message for the artist.</p>
								<p>Finally, in the Library page, users can create and view the playlist they make, or discover public playlists that other users have made. The Listener Profile page lets users view other user profiles, which include a user's favorite artists, favorite genres, reposted videos, and playlists. Users can also add another user as a friend, so that user's reposted videos can be sent to their Home page, not only helping the algorithm further align a user's taste, but it also adds a fun way for friends to share what music they like directly to other users. </p>
								<p>As for this design, while it is a prototype, I still think it does a solid job at illustrating how a proposed app like this would function. One (of many) things I would change if I came back to this project would be that a lot of the clickables aren't very obviously clickable, so users might not know exactly what they can and cant click on. For example, the "Click Here to Support the Artist!" button on an Artist's Profile page. While it does say "Click Here", it would be nice if it was text overlayed on a button. On the support the Artist page, the "See more â†’" buttons would be more noticable as buttons to the user if they had a background or something to tell the user that it is clickable, other than just an arrow.</p>
