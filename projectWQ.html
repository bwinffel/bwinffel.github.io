									<h1>"Whose Queued" <br /> App Concept and UI Design<br /></h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Whose Queued Thumbs.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This is a smartphone party game I conceptualized and designed as a personal project that would allow friends to group up and listen to music together and to guess who knows each other's music taste the best. I created 11 screens to showcase the app's proposed functions, including setting up a lobby, playing a game, showcasing how the shared device mode would function, and more. I also created a video walkthrough of the app via Figma's presentation mode in order to showcase all of the screens properly, rather than flood this page with screenshots.  </p>
								<p>The game works like a guessing game where you and your friends party up, and everyone selects a song to play via their preferred streaming service. While a song is playing, everyone can guess who queued up that song, hence the name "<i>Whose Queued?</i>".</p>
								<p>Firstly, users must make an account and link their preferred streaming service. The player who would host the lobby would need to link whichever music streaming services that the players in their lobby would like to use. After that, the host can create the lobby, and up to 7 other players can join via their own devices, or the host can enable shared device mode, and can have any number of people in the group use their device to queue their own music, as well as make guesses. </p>
								<h2 class="no-bottom-margin">Login, Account Settings, Lobby and Settings</h2>
								<div class="image fit no-top-margin"><img src="images/LoginAccountLobbySettings.png" alt="" /> </div>
								<p>After a song has finished and everyone has made their guesses, voting results are revealed, and players can see who voted the specific song for who, as well as how many votes were placed for each player. In the default mode: "Dynamic Points Mode", points are distributed and the number of points a player gets depends on how many people made correct guesses. If a song is obviously from a specific person, if everyone guesses that person, everyone only gets a few points, but if the song is challenging to guess and only one person manages to be correct, they get a large amount of points. The cycle of listening, voting, and results continues until the end of the game when all songs have been played, and the final point totals are revealed. In other modes, the cycle differs.</p>
								<p>For example in "Party Mode", the emphasis is taken off of voting and voting is made optional, but music plays to completion, and point are only counted and distributed at the very end when all songs are played. In the other mode, "Mystery Mode", players instead skip choosing a song by hand, and the game takes a random song from a random playlist of each player. In that way, even the player whose song it is may have to guess if that song is from their own music library!  </p>
								<h2 class="no-bottom-margin">Lobby Settings Screen</h2>
								<div class="image fit no-top-margin"><img src="images/AlbumGlow.png" alt="" /> </div>
								<p>As for the design itself, I wanted it to be sleek and practical. For a party game, you want something that is as frictionless and easy to understand as possible, that way people can very easily pick up and play the game and get to the fun as fast as they can. With a more complex app concept such as this, I found it suprisingly challenging yet fun to design something to take the complex and make it a simple and streamlined process. </p>
								<p>I'm a more practical person who prefers function over form, but in spite of this, I still understand that form is just as important as function in creating an enjoyable user experience. My personal trick to find and strike the balance is that minor visual changes can really add to the form without detracting from the function. I achieved this by making the album art for songs have a glow around them that matches a dominant color of the album, as well as the progress bar being the same color. This album art border glow is also visible while choosing a song. Something small yet striking like this can really add to the feel of a design, as it really puts a subtle emphasis on a user's song choice.</p>
								<p>Below is my video demonstration of the app as I walkthrough how the app would work as well as some of my proposed features, via Figma prototype.  </p>

								</div>
								<p>The idea for this project is something that I've thought about for a few years now and I've really wanted to make it a reality for a while now, in any form possible, so I'll be taking the next steps into developing this app myself. Ideally, this game would be a great pitch as an addition to an existing music streaming service like Spotify or Apple Music, and I could see it becoming a really popular and engaging way to not only encourage people to listen to more music, but to listen to more music <i>together</i>.</p>
								<p>This project is something I'm both very passionate about, and very proud of, so I'll update this portfolio periodically with the app's development progress.</p>
